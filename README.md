# ss14-midi-dump
This collection includes both other people's and my own finds. Some tracks will be duplicates compared to other compilatons/collections and other tracks are probably going to be brand new.

All tracks and folders should be sorted (somewhat) rationally, allowing for easy listening and usage. If something is out of place, feel free to contact me or fix it yourself or something.

Obviously, feel free to take from this collection and add it to your own, that's mostly what I did anyways.

But before you do, take a second to enjoy the presence of this cat:

## The Cat

Thank you for your time.
