# ss14-midi-dump
Midis I collected to play on Space Station 14, found from like a dozen different sources. (probably more to be honest.)

All tracks and folders should be sorted (somewhat) rationally.

Obviously, feel free to take stuff from this repo and add it to your own collection, that's mostly what I've done anyways.

But before you do, take a second to enjoy the presence of this cat:

## The Cat
![a cat that stares at u (by unknown) tp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5135960b-ac01-4da1-8430-01a1da99340d)

Thank you for your time.
